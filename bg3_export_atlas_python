# Python File Organizer Script

## Overview

This Python script simplifies the process of organizing and renaming files into specific folders based on predefined labels. The script allows users to:
- Rename a file.
- Move or copy files to labeled folders.
- Prompt users to select labels with pre-configured destination paths.

### Supported Labels
The script supports the following labels with respective folder destinations:
- **Skills144**: `ControllerUIIcons/skills_png`
- **Items144**: `ControllerUIIcons/items_png`
- **Skills380**: `Tooltips/Icons`
- **Items380**: `Tooltips/ItemIcons`

## Features
- Interactive user prompts to select labels and define file names.
- Renames files dynamically based on user input.
- Copies files to respective folders based on labels.
- Allows batch processing for multiple file sets.
- Ensures folders are created if they do not already exist.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or later
- Required Libraries: None (uses standard Python libraries)

### Setup
1. Download the script and save it to a folder of your choice.
2. Place the files you want to organize in the same directory as the script.

## Usage
1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python organize_files.py
   ```
2. Follow the prompts:
   - Enter the base file name (without suffixes).
   - Select the label for the file.
   - Confirm if more files need processing.

3. The script will organize files as per the label's destination folder.

### Example
If you enter a base file name `icon_set` and select the label `Skills144`, the script will:
1. Copy the file `icon_set.png` to the folder `ControllerUIIcons/skills_png`.
2. Ensure the folder exists before copying.

## Troubleshooting
### Permissions Error
If you encounter a permissions error when creating folders or copying files:
- Run the script with elevated permissions (e.g., Administrator on Windows).
- Ensure the script has write access to the destination folder.

### File Not Found
Make sure the files are in the same directory as the script or specify the correct paths during prompts.
